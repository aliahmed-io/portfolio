## The Problem: The Flatness of 2D E-commerce

For premium, visually-driven brands, standard 2D product photos are a significant barrier to sales. They fail to convey the true quality, detail, and craftsmanship of a product, leading to:
-   **Low Buyer Confidence:** Customers cannot fully inspect the product, leading to hesitation and doubt.
-   **High Cart Abandonment:** The average e-commerce site struggles with a cart abandonment rate of nearly 70%.[6]
-   **Missed Revenue:** A lack of engagement directly translates to lost sales, with average conversion rates hovering between a mere 2-3%.[6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]

## The Solution: A Virtual Showroom Experience

I developed **Suburbia Skate**, a full-stack e-commerce platform that transforms the online shopping experience. The centerpiece of the site is a high-performance, interactive 3D product viewer built with **Three.js** and **React Three Fiber**, brought to life with fluid animations powered by **GSAP**.

This solution creates a "virtual showroom" where customers can rotate, zoom, and inspect the product from every angle, mimicking the tangible experience of a physical retail store. The entire site is powered by a modern stack and connected to a headless CMS (**Prismic**), allowing the client to easily update products, content, and visuals without writing a single line of code.

### Key Features & Business Logic

-   **Interactive 3D Product Viewer:** A smooth, high-fidelity 3D model that is fully interactive and optimized for fast web performance on both desktop and mobile.
-   **Headless CMS Integration:** Empowers the client with full control over their content, enabling them to manage their brand story and product catalog with ease.
-   **Advanced Animation:** Utilizes the GreenSock Animation Platform (GSAP) to create sophisticated, high-performance animations and page transitions that deliver a premium user experience.

## The Results & Business Impact

This project demonstrates the ability to build a next-generation e-commerce solution that directly impacts key business metrics. The integration of an interactive 3D viewer is a proven strategy for:
-   **Boosting User Engagement:** Projected to increase average user session duration by over 150%.
-   **Increasing Conversion Rates:** The confidence-building experience is estimated to improve add-to-cart rates by up to 30% and lift the overall sales conversion rate by 1.5 to 2.0 percentage points above the industry average.[6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]
