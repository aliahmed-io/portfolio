## My Services

As I launch my specialized freelance practice, I am offering a one-time **Portfolio Builder Rate** for my first 2-3 foundational clients.

This is a unique opportunity to receive premium, dedicated development services at a strategic price point. In exchange for this rate, I ask for a detailed testimonial and your permission to feature our successful project in a case study. This is a partnership designed for mutual success: you receive an exceptional product that drives business growth, and I gain the social proof to build my brand.
